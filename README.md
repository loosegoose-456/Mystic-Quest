# Mystic-Quest

Mystic Realm is a 2D action-adventure game developed in Python using Pygame. Originally based on an open-source project by [Clear Code](https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Zelda), this version significantly extends and enhances the gameplay with new mechanics, adaptive AI, and redesigned systems.

## 🧠 About the Project

Mystic Realm includes:

- A complete AI overhaul using PyTorch to simulate enemy learning from player behavior
- A new boss battle mode featuring dynamic enemy adaptation and health-based strategies
- Fleeing and regeneration logic for low-health enemies
- A fully functional upgrade system with real-time in-game attribute adjustments
- Multiple user interfaces including start menus, pause screens, and upgrade menus
- Enhanced performance and gameplay flow from deep structural code changes
